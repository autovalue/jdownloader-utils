 *     Some parts of the [The Product] use or reference 3rd party libraries and classes. These parts may have different licensing conditions. Please check the *.license and *.info files of included libraries
 *     to ensure that they are compatible to your use-case. Further more, some *.java have their own license. In this case, they have their license terms in the java file header. 	
 * 	
 * === Definition: Commercial Usage ===
 *     If anybody or any organization is generating income (directly or indirectly) by using [The Product] or if there's any commercial interest or aspect in what you are doing, we consider this as a commercial usage.
 *     If your use-case is neither strictly private nor strictly educational, it is commercial. If you are unsure whether your use-case is commercial or not, consider it as commercial or contact us.
 * === Dual Licensing ===
